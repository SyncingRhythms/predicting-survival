# Titanic Survival

Using Kaggle's Titanic datasets, I attempt to predict survival for each passenger. Hence, this project offers a classification problem. I offer two model solutions using,

1. Random Forests 
2. Ensembling with Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression 

Prior to each model testing on novel data, I implement:
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Visualization
- 3-fold Cross Validation

Testing of each model on untrained data is executed in the python files ending in _test.
